# Reddit Elastic Search with Kibana Visualization

	A simple elasticsearch that stores and displays subreddit threads every 10 minutes.
	It takes threads from new, controversial, rising, and hot; and store the following information: 
		thread's ID, author, title, number of comments, subreddit category, and score
		
	These information are used for display in the main dashboard of Kibana.
	The main idea of this project is to figure out the most active subreddit threads
	via by most threads created or by the most number of comments.
	 

## Currently, there are 3 Visuals:

	Top 100 Most Frequent Subreddit
	Top 50 Most active Subreddit
	Top 25 Most commented Subreddit

## Top 100 Most Frequent Subreddit

	Displays the top 100 counts of subreddit categories in a pie chart

## Top 50 Most active Subreddit
	
	Displays the top 50 counts of subreddit categories in a tag cloud

## Top 25 Most commented Subreddit

	Displays the top 25 counts of number of comments subreddit categories in a bar graph
