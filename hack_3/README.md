# CS499-Hackathon 3

## Machine Learning Algorithm - Supervised Learning

For this project, we used road id, direction, day of the week, and time of day to predict the traffic status. We feed in all 5 information including the traffic status to accumulate our training data. By using the training data, we are able to predict the traffic status. We used the logistic regression model because the traffic status is fixed between 1 to 10. By using the logistic regression, we get the category in which the result belongs to.
